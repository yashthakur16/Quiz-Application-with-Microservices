# Quiz Application with Microservices

This is a Spring Boot-based quiz application that leverages a microservices architecture for handling quizzes and questions. The application includes independent services for managing quizzes and questions and uses Eureka for service discovery, along with Feign for communication between the services.

## Features

- **Quiz Customization:** Users can create custom quizzes by selecting the number of questions and difficulty level (easy, medium, hard).
- **Question Service:** Manages technical questions related to CS fundamentals, stored in PostgreSQL, and categorized by difficulty.
- **Eureka Server:** Manages service discovery for scalable and modular architecture.
- **Feign Client:** Used for efficient communication between the Quiz Service and the Question Service.
- **Scalability:** The microservices architecture allows for the creation of multiple instances to handle high traffic and usage.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**
- **Microservices Architecture**
- **Eureka Server** (for service discovery)
- **Feign Client** (for inter-service communication)
- **PostgreSQL** (for database storage)
- **Maven** (for dependency management)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher
- Maven
- PostgreSQL
- Eureka Server running

### Steps to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yashthakur16/Quiz-Application-with-Microservices.git
   cd Quiz-Application-with-Microservices
   ```

2. **Set up the PostgreSQL Database:**
   - Create a PostgreSQL database for storing quiz and question data.
   - Update the `application.properties` or `application.yml` in both the Quiz and Question services with your PostgreSQL credentials.

3. **Start Eureka Server:**
   Navigate to the `eureka-server` directory and run the server:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

4. **Start the Microservices:**
   Navigate to the `quiz-service` and `question-service` directories separately and run:
   ```bash
